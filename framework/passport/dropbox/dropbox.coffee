    # ----------------------
    # To support persistent login sessions, Passport needs to be able to serialize users into and deserialize users out of the session. Typically, this will be as simple as storing the user ID when serializing, and finding the user by ID when deserializing.  However, since this example does not have a database of user records, the complete Dropbox profile is serialized and deserialized.

    # Use the DropboxStrategy within Passport
    # Strategies in passport require a `verify` function, which accept credentials (in this case, a token, tokenSecret, and Dropbox profile), and invoke a callback with a user object.
    passport.use(new DropboxStrategy({
        consumerKey: app.get 'dropbox key'
