Use that file to store environment specific settings and other pieces of information you don't want in source control.\r\n\r\n## Durandal\r\n\r\nAn express plugin to host the contents of /odo/durandal-public to the web so the custom durandal components can be used by your odo durandal application.\r\n\r\n## Eventstore\r\n\r\nA component to requirejs into your application to setup and connect to an eventstore. Exposes an extend method to add methods and properties to an aggregate object to support event sourcing and the CQRS pattern. Uses the eventstore library.\r\n\r\n## Express\r\n\r\nThe root component to requirejs into your application to setup an express server. Call it as a method and provide a list of odo express plugins to load into the runtime.\r\n\r\n## Handlebars\r\n\r\nAn express plugin to extend the default handlebars implementation with additional features to support layouts, hooks and more.\r\n\r\n## Hub\r\n\r\nA component to requirejs into your application to create a CQRS hub that is connected to redis. Bind event listers through the exported receive method and bind command handlers through the exported handle method. Use send and publish to send commands and publish events.\r\n\r\n## Injectinto\r\n\r\nA component to requirejs into your application to provide the service locator pattern. Bind items to key string values and request items through the one, oneornull, and many methods.\r\nUses the injectinto library behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n## Peek\r\n\r\nAdd the ability to 'peek' a request in express without fulfilling the request. This supports incremental loading of resources for templating, shared url authentication and other composition patterns. Uses the peekinto library behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n## Twitter Auth\r\n\r\nAn express plugin that provides urls and methods to authenticate a user with twitter. Also hosts the twitterauth-public so durandal applications can communicate with the api.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
